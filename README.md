# Simple-crypto-bot
This is an example of how you can use the Binance API to create an automatic trading bot using Bollinger Bands or RSI just add the code to a Python workspace and add your keys then add your parameters then sit back and relax. PLEASE NOTE: I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR SO PLEASE USE THE BOT AT YOUR OWN RISK AS IT!
